# Contribution Guidelines

### Style Guidelines
 1. Use spaces, not tabs. Tab users will be held in fake contempt.
 2. All variable names must be written backwards.

### Pull Requests
 - I will respond to pull requests within 2<sup>0</sup> and 2<sup>55</sup> seconds.
 - Flipping a coin will be an acceptable decider in case of indecision around accepting a pull request.
